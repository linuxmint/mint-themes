# Mint-Y-Colors

**Pure. Energized. And readable.**

This directory contains the proposed new accent colors to be discussed and exported, for all Mint-Y variations. Any other Mint-Y color related work could also be placed here.

Here in this directory you can find SVG files for previews, and text files containing #hex color values to be copy-pasted or imported into CSS, SVG, scripts and programs.
