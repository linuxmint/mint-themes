# Mint-Y new colors
* I started working on this fork on 2020/02/11.
* WARNING: it is not ready yet. I am working on my local computer and this remote is not up-to-date. I want to learn Git quickly and soon figure out how to sync this GitHub, update this GitHub, from the work made on my local HDD. I mean, of course i know how to edit some files, update them one by one, here on GitHub. But i am editing and testing many files here at home, and i hope i will find some way to keep GitHub up-to-date with the work done on my computer, automatically. I think this is precisely one of the things Git does? I should start learning more about Git pretty soon!
* All the Mint-Y colors will be changed.
* I am also working on some other minor edits.
