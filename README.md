# Mint-Y new colors
* I started working on this fork on 2020/02/11. WARNING: it is not ready yet. I am working on my local computer and this remote is not up-to-date. I want to learn Git quickly and soon figure out how to sync this GitHub, update this GitHub, from the work made on my local HDD.
* All the Mint-Y colors will be changed.
* I am also working on some other minor edits.
